## 🤔 What is MathMate Insights?

MathMate Insights is a text-to-math solution built using:

- **🌐 Streamlit**: For an intuitive and interactive user interface.
- **🔗 LangChain Framework**: For orchestrating AI-driven solutions.
- **🤖 ChatGroq LLM (Gemma2-9b-It)**: A high-performance language model to parse and interpret text.
- **📘 LangChain Utilities**: Including WikipediaAPIWrapper for contextual references and LLMMathChain for computations.

## ⚙️ How Does MathMate Insights Work?

1. **✍️ Input**: Users input queries in natural language (e.g., "What is the derivative of x^2 + 3x?").
2. **🔄 Processing**: 
    - The input is parsed using ChatGroq, which converts it into a structured format.
    - Relevant mathematical operations are handled using LangChain's LLMMathChain.
    - Contextual data (if required) is fetched using WikipediaAPIWrapper.
3. **📤 Output**: The solution is displayed, along with any relevant explanations or references.

### 🧩 Code Overview:
```python
import streamlit as st
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain, LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_community.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper
from langchain.agents.agent_types import AgentType
from langchain.agents import Tool, initialize_agent
from langchain.callbacks import StreamlitCallbackHandler

# Initialize the LLM
llm = ChatGroq(model="Gemma2-9b-It", groq_api_key=groq_api_key)

# Additional code to handle queries and integrate components goes here
```
